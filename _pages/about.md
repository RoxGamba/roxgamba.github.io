Welcome! I am an incoming N3AS fellow at UC Berkeley and Penn State University working on
modeling the **gravitational waves** emitted by compact binary coalescences.

On this website you will learn about me and my research.
If you are interested in what I do and would like to contact me, feel free
to drop me an email or message me on Twitter.
