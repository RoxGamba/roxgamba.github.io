Welcome! I am an incoming N3AS fellow at UC Berkeley and Penn State University working on
modeling the **gravitational waves** emitted by compact binary coalescences.

On this website you will learn about me and my research:
* [here](publications) you can find a list of some of my work;
* [here](cv) you can look at and download my Curriculum Vitae;
* [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuRLOlB4N8U) you can find a playlist of some great cat videos

If you are interested in what I do and would like to contact me, feel free
to drop me an email or message me on Twitter.
