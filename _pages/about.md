Welcome! I am a N3AS fellow at UC Berkeley and Penn State University working on
modeling the **gravitational waves** emitted by compact binary coalescences.
I am the main maintainer of <a href="https://teobresums.bitbucket.io">teobresums</a>,
an open-source waveform model based on the **effective-one-body formalism**.
I also dabble in **numerical relativity**, performing simulations of mergers using
the open-source **GR-Athena++** and **AthenaK** codes, and in **data analysis** of
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data.

Outside of research, I enjoy playing Magic the Gathering with my friends,
reading and traveling the world. I am a huge Juventus fan, and my mood
often depends on how well la Vecchia Signora is doing.

On this website you will learn about me and my work.
To start:
- Check out my [publications](/publications) page for a list of my papers;
- Visit my [blog](/blog) for posts about my research, outreach activities, and more;
- Get inspired by the [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3ji5L19X3AeaHeUG3RPfIN?si=zAM65KG3TRCysM7k1YJemA)
  I sneaked into the acknowledgments of my papers.


If you are interested in what I do and would like to contact me, feel free
to drop me an email or message me on Twitter!
