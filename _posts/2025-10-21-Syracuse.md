On Tuesday I gave a seminar at Syracuse University about modeling mergers of black holes on generic orbits. It was great to visit the campus and meet
with [Alex](https://artsandsciences.syracuse.edu/people/faculty/alexander-nitz/?_gl=1*sd5n1s*_gcl_au*Nzk4MzU5OTAzLjE3NjEyMzc1ODk.#Biography) and his [research group](https://gravitationalwaves.syracuse.edu/). We got to discuss future collaborations and I (finally) learned something about gravitational wave searches!

I also almost tried a sushi burrito, before getting shamed out of the idea. Maybe next time?
